(test corr
  "Testing correlation coefficient. To quote from wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance)
 In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables. If the greater values of one variable mainly correspond with the greater values of the other variable, and the same holds for the lesser values, (i.e., the variables tend to show similar behavior), the covariance is positive. In the opposite case, when the greater values of one variable mainly correspond to the lesser values of the other, (i.e., the variables tend to show opposite behavior), the covariance is negative. The sign of the covariance therefore shows the tendency in the linear relationship between the variables. The magnitude of the covariance is not easy to interpret because it is not normalized and hence depends on the magnitudes of the variables. The normalized version of the covariance, the correlation coefficient, however, shows by its magnitude the strength of the linear relation."

Here is an example of a function with an ordinality column added:

SELECT * FROM unnest(ARRAY['a','b','c','d','e','f']) WITH ORDINALITY;


https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-select.html
This example uses LATERAL to apply a set-returning function get_product_names() for each row of the manufacturers table:

SELECT m.name AS mname, pname
FROM manufacturers m, LATERAL get_product_names(m.id) pname;

Manufacturers not currently having any products would not appear in the result, since it is an inner join. If we wished to include the names of such manufacturers in the result, we could do:

SELECT m.name AS mname, pname
FROM manufacturers m LEFT JOIN LATERAL get_product_names(m.id) pname ON true;
